# elderlyjs
A transpiler helping the elderly catch up with the glorious success of modern JavaScript

# Languages to be supported in the future:
- **FORTRAN** - An all time favorite of the elderly.
- **ALGOL 68** - A superior version to ALGOL 60.
- **LISP** - The de facto language used for artificial intelligence programming.
- **COBOL** - The **Co**mmon weapon of choice for any **B**usiness **O**riented company as their primary **L**anguage
- **Perl** - Second only to the JavaScript itself in the area of blazing-fast, reactive, interactive websites.
- **Pascal** - With it's simple, yet functional syntax, no wonder this is the leading choice in the ML sphere of the 80s.
- **Haskell** - An underdog among the elderly. Its OOP concepts were developed ahead of its time.
- **PHP** - This is what people start mumbling when they get old.
- **Ada** - A nondeterministic programming language that the elderly use for their current web projects.
